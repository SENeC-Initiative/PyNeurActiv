===================================
Neuronal activity package (SENeC-I)
===================================

PyNeurActv pacakage to study the simulated activity of neural networks.
This package is part of the broader SENeC initiative for the study of neuronal
cultures and devices.


Content
=======

`analysis`
	Tools to analyze data related to neuronal activity, especially in link
    with simulations involving [NEST][nest] or [NNGT][nngt].
`io`
    Input/output functions to load and plot, sometimes based on [Neo][neo].
`lib`
    Generic tools used throughout the modules.
